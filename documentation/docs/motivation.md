Since Nextjs 8.0, [serverless mode](https://nextjs.org/blog/next-8#serverless-nextjs) was introduced which provides a new low level API which projects like this can use to deploy onto different cloud providers. This project is a better version of the [serverless plugin](https://github.com/danielcondemarin/serverless-next.js/tree/master/packages/serverless-nextjs-plugin) which focuses on addressing core issues like [next 9 support](https://github.com/danielcondemarin/serverless-nextjs-plugin/issues/101), [better development experience](https://github.com/danielcondemarin/serverless-nextjs-plugin/issues/59), [the 200 CloudFormation resource limit](https://github.com/danielcondemarin/serverless-nextjs-plugin/issues/17) and [performance](https://github.com/danielcondemarin/serverless-nextjs-plugin/issues/13).
